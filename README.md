Netflix Recommendation Project
Overview
Welcome to the Netflix Recommendation Project! ðŸŽ¬ This project is your personalized guide to discovering exciting new shows and movies on Netflix. Using advanced natural language processing and machine learning techniques, we've created a recommendation system that tailors suggestions based on the content you love.

How It Works
Data Magic: We've harnessed the power of Netflix's extensive dataset, including titles, descriptions, genres, and more.

Clean and Transform: Our cleaning process ensures that every piece of information is pristine. We convert text to lowercase, eliminate special characters, and even kick out those pesky stopwords.
