## 🚀 How It Works

3. **TF-IDF Sorcery:** Transforming text into feature-rich vectors using the mystical power of Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF).

4. **Cosmic Similarity:** Enter the realm of cosine similarity, measuring the cosmic alignment between vectors and unveiling hidden connections.
